My personnal AutoHotKey script

My keyboard was lacking some features likes multimedia hotkeys and so on.

Using AutoHotKey, I solved this problem, but autohotkey needs a script files
which is the purpose of the repo. It's interesting to note that AutoHotkey actually allows you to bind any kind of macro to any kind of keyboard key
combination, which means there would be some game macros and other stuff here

In this file there is:
- Multimedia shortcuts using the right windows key and the F keys
- Chat macros for league of legends
